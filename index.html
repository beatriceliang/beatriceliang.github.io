	<h2>Hi, I'm Beatrice (or Bea or Bee)! </h2> 
	<p>I graduated from Columbia University in May 2018 with a Master of Science in Computer Science.
		I was a member of the <a href="http://roam.me.columbia.edu"> ROAM Lab</a>, 
		where I studied Reinforcement Learning and wrote my thesis on 
		<a href='/assets/thesis.pdf'> Robot Learning in Simulation for Grasping and Manipulation</a>.
	</p>
	<p>I received my Bachelor of Arts from Colby College, where 
		I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences with a Concentration in Statistics.
		While in college, I was a Teaching Assistant for Computational Thinking, Data Structures and
		Algorithms, and Data Analysis and Visualization. I also was a Computer Science Extern at the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
		took part in the Passionate on Parallel REU at the University of Illiois at Urbana-Champaign.
	</p>
	<p>Also, fun fact, I was a chorister at the Washington National Cathedral through middle school and high school.
